Hello there! Today I'm excited to share a guide on using cloud images in Proxmox. If you've ever found yourself repeatedly creating VMs and going through the same configuration steps, this post is for you! We'll explore how to leverage cloud images with cloud-init for automated VM deployments - it's like having a personal VM chef that prepares your instances exactly how you like them.

## What We're Working With

Before we dive in, here's what we'll be using in this guide:
* Proxmox version 8.3.0 (the star of our show)
* Ubuntu 22.04 (our trusty workbench)
* A cup of coffee (optional but recommended)

## Image Prep: Getting Everything Ready

First things first - we need to prepare our cloud image. We'll be working on an Ubuntu host because, well, Proxmox and `libguestfs-tools` don't play nice together (they're like cats and cucumbers). The `libguestfs-tools` package is our magic wand here - it lets us modify images without even booting them up!

Let's start by grabbing a fresh cloud image:

```bash
curl -O https://cloud-images.ubuntu.com/releases/jammy/release/ubuntu-22.04-server-cloudimg-amd64.img
```

Now, let's get our tools ready:

```bash
sudo apt install libguestfs-tools -y
```

Here comes the interesting part - we're going to install the `qemu-guest-agent` into our image. This little helper allows Proxmox to peek inside the VM and manage it better:

```bash
sudo virt-customize -a ubuntu-22.04-server-cloudimg-amd64.img --install qemu-guest-agent
```

Time to move our prepared image to its new home:

```bash
scp ubuntu-22.04-server-cloudimg-amd64.img root@proxmox:/tmp/
```

## The Proxmox Dance: Setting Up Our Template

Now we're getting to the good stuff! Let's create a VM that will serve as our template:

```bash
qm create 9022 \
  --name ubuntu-2204-cloud-init --numa 0 --ostype l26 \
  --cpu cputype=host --cores 2 --sockets 8 \
  --memory 8192  \
  --net0 virtio,bridge=vmbr0
```

Import our prepared image to storage:

```bash
qm importdisk 9022 ubuntu-22.04-server-cloudimg-amd64.img SSD
```

Let's hook up the disk (SCSI style):

```bash
qm set 9022 --scsihw virtio-scsi-pci --scsi0 SSD:vm-9022-disk-0
```

Now for the cloud-init magic - this is what makes our VM configurable on boot:

```bash
qm set 9022 --ide2 SSD:cloudinit
```

Make sure our VM knows where to boot from:

```bash
qm set 9022 --boot c --bootdisk scsi0
```

Add a serial console (some cloud images get chatty and need this):

```bash
qm set 9022 --serial0 socket --vga serial0
```

Enable our friendly neighborhood guest agent:

```bash
qm set 9022 --agent enabled=1
```

Time to make this VM a template (it's graduation day!):

```bash
qm template 9022
```

Let's give it our SSH key - no more password prompts:

```bash
qm set 9022 --sshkey ~/.ssh/luis.pub
```

And for testing purposes, we'll assign it a static IP:

```bash
qm set 9022 --ipconfig0 ip=192.168.8.212/24,gw=192.168.8.254
```

## Creating Your First Cloud-Init VM

Now for the moment of truth - let's create a VM from our template:

```bash
qm clone 9022 999 \
  --name ubuntu-test \
  --full \
  --storage local-zfs
```

Once it boots up, you can SSH right in using the default username (`ubuntu` for Ubuntu cloud images) and the SSH key we configured. No muss, no fuss!

## Why This is Awesome

This setup is particularly handy because:
1. Your VMs come pre-configured with your SSH keys
2. No need to go through installation wizards
3. Perfect for automation with tools like Terraform (stay tuned for that post!)
4. Consistent VM deployments every time

## Wrapping Up

And there you have it! A streamlined way to deploy VMs in Proxmox using cloud images and cloud-init. No more clicking through installers or manually configuring each VM - just clone and go! In a future post, I'll show you how to take this even further with Terraform automation.

Until then, happy virtualizing! ðŸš€

P.S. If you run into any issues, remember the IT golden rule: "Have you tried turning it off and on again?" (Just kidding, but sometimes it actually works!)
